														<h2>Project Outbreak || Co Owner - AI Lead</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p>Rather than taking a traditional placement year I joined some other students that we met during a game jam to start our 
													own games company called Indie-Shark Games. Where we spent the year developing our own game called Project: Outbreak. </p> <p>
													Project Outbreak is a top down roguelike so as the AI lead I had to develop enemies which were in depth working together 
													using squad behaviours and modular enough so when generating random selection of enemies they were able to work together in
													any situation whilst still feeling fair for the player.  </p> 
													<p> We went to events and joined Game Republic to advertise our game and the company and was able to take it to Transfuzer 2020. </p> <p>
													Unfortunately since some members had another year of university the project was left as a vertical slice which we are all proud of. </p>

														<h2>Bind and Banish</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p> For my Final Year Team Project as a team of 7 we developed a first person ghost capturing game.  </p>
													<p> My main role in the team is AI programmer in which I developed my own avoidance system and several different AI behaviours using a finite state machine to control the ghost current behaviour. Currently the behaviours created are. </p>
													<br /> - Flying around the room in a zig zag pattern
													<br /> - Hiding in an object, turning off and on lights then possessing a new object
													<br /> - When revealed fly around the room, throw objects at the player and taunt toward the player	
													<br /> - Gather in groups, Wander around the hotel using Unity Nav Mesh to calculate the path but use my movement system to navigate to each point
													<br /> - There are several switchboard around the hotel which they can interact with and turning off lights for sections of the map
													<p> I also worked on several other system but the ghost movement system is the work I am most proud of </p>  
													<p> Won the Best Team award from The Game Republic Student Showcase 2021 </p>

														<h2>A* PATHFINDING (68%) </h2>
														<h2>C++ and OGRE Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p> This program was for an assignment in which I developed a A* pathfinding solution using C++ and Ogre libraries. </p>
													<p> The gif demonstrates the building of walls in the level and two characters which will calculate a path and head towards. </p> 
													<p> There is another character standing on the left which is a threat to one of the characters so it gives a weight to the node 
													the closer it is to that character which can be seen by the change in colour from white to dark red. The weight is also taken 
													into consideration when calculating the path.  </p>

														<h2>A Spoonful Night - VR GameJam</h2>
														<h2>C#, Unity and SteamVR libraries</h2>
													</header>
													<p>This game was developed during a gamejam during second year of university.
													</p><p> The main loop is you are in a pub and must play games to get money and keep your drunkiness at a range too drunk and you pass out and not drunk enough you go home. </p> 
													</p>I personally was responsible for the creation of two arcade machines (Breakout and Slots), ordering drinks, handling player information of drunkiness, bladder level and money as well as 
													creating the game end states (walk to the pub, pass out and walk to taxi).</p>

														<h2>Unity C# Developed Android Game</h2>

													<p>Tipsy Tower is a game that I challenged myself to develop over two weekends and it was my first Android based game. 
													</p><p>It's a simple but addictive tower stacking game. Where the player must keep stacking falling blocks. 
													Any blocks that fall off the platform will cost a life.</p>

														<h2>Monster Manhatten</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed Android Game</h2>
													</header>
													<p> Monster Manhattan was developed for a week long game jam </p>
													<p> My tasks in this game jam was to develop a never ending track generator which could spawn more difficult track pieces as time passed </p>
													<p> Also I created the enemy attacks which are attacking both lanes at once that can be dodged by going backwards or forwards and an attack
													which only hits one lane but sends out rocks which will travel along the lanes so you should swap to another lane </p>
													<p> Finally I tracked UI elements and created powerups </p>
