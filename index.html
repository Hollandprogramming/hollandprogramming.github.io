														<h2>Project Outbreak || Co Owner - AI Lead</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p>Rather than taking a traditional placement year I joined some other students which we met during a game jam to start our 
													own games company called Indie-Shark Games. Where we spent the year developing our own game called Project: Outbreak. </p> <p>
													Project Outbreak is a top down roguelike so as the AI lead I had to develop enemies which were in depth working together 
													using squad behaviours and modular enough so when generating random selection of enemies they were able to work together in
													any situation whilst still feeling fair for the player.  </p> 
													<p> We went to events and joined Game Republic to advertise our game and the company and was able to take it to Transfuzer 2020. </p> <p>
													Unfortunately since some members had another year of university the project was left as a vertical slice which we are all proud of. </p>

													<p>DTH is my submission for the Search for a Star 2021 Grads in Games competition.
													The game was built upon a given codebase and I was given the opportunity to build upon
													this codebase to prove my skills as a creative game developer and to showcase my
													strong programming skills.</p>
													<p>For the project I ranked 13th place out of 54th </p>
													<p>I also had to a C++ test this part of the competition is still being graded.</p>

														<h2>A Spoonful Night - VR GameJam</h2>
														<h2>C#, Unity and SteamVR libraries</h2>
													</header>
													<p>This game was developed during a gamejam during second year of university.
													</p><p> The main loop is you are in a pub and must play games to get money and keep your drunkiness at a range too drunk and you pass out and not drunk enough you go home. </p> 
													</p>I personally was responsible for the creation of two arcade machines (Breakout and Slots), ordering drinks, handling player information of drunkiness, bladder level and money as well as 
													creating the game end states (walk to the pub, pass out and walk to taxi).</p>

														<h2>C++ and OGRE Developed</h2>

													<p>The A* pathfinding was also another assignment that I did in Year 2. It is developed in 
													C++ and using Ogre libraries. The gif demonstrates building walls in the level and the two 
													characters moving to the given using A* pathfinding which I developed. </p>
													<p>The character on the left is a threat to one of the character and increases the weight 
													of that route meaning the one character will walk around the threat whereas the other character wont.</p>

														<h2>Tipsy Tower</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed Android Game</h2>
													</header>
													<p>Tipsy Tower is a game that I challenged myself to develop over two weekends and it was my first Android based game. 
													</p><p>It's a simple but addictive tower stacking game. Where the player must keep stacking falling blocks. 
													Any blocks that fall off the platform will cost a life.</p>

														<h2>G.H.O.S.T - Final Year Team Project</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p>For my Final Year Team Project as a team of 6 we developed a first person ghost capturing game.  </p><p>
													My main role in the team is AI programmer in which I developed several different AI behaviours using finite state machine decisions. These include
													<br />- Wandering around the hotel and grouping up 
													<br /> - Hiding in rooms, turning lights off and on to teleport to a new object
													<br />- When revealed they will run around the room, throw objects at the player, repossess objects and taunt towards the player </p>
													<p> All ghost movements uses my own avoidance system </p>
													<p> The game is still being developed for my assignment so a demo is not ready at the moment. </p>
